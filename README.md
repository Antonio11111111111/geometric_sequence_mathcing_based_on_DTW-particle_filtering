# geometric_sequence_mathcing_based_on_DTW-particle_filtering
This is the repository of my research training project, which relates to geometric positioning. ALL the members of this project should push their codes to this repository

## coding rules
### general rules
1. all the code and the comments MUST BE WRITEN IN ENGLISH
2. all the file names must be written like this:
  use capital letter at the beginning of each word, and connect them with undeline '_'. .i.e: Hello_World
3. all the function names should obey the same rule as rule No.2
4. all the name of functions and variables should use the termidology(in the part termidology or glossary)
### termidology or glossary
面积、大小：size 

长度：len

宽度：width

高度：h

地磁场：geometric

滤波器：filter

生成器：generator

地图：map

路线：route

粒子：particle

序列：sequence

主程序：MAIN

测试程序：TEST_n (n must be replace to a number, whatever number you what unless the name is already used)

准备做：//TODO
### comment 
comment shuold contain:

parameter, output, function description, and example of the function(usage)

**the file Geometric_Map_Generator.m should be read before writing other codes**
