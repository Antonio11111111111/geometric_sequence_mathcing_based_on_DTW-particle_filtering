# geometric_sequence_mathcing_based_on_DTW-particle_filtering
This is the repository of my research training project, which relates to geometric positioning. ALL the members of this project should push their codes to this repository

## coding rules
### general rules
1. all the code and the comments MUST BE WRITEN IN ENGLISH
2. all the file names must be written like this:
  use capital letter at the beginning of each word, and connect them with undeline '_'. .i.e: Hello_World
